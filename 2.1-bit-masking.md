# Bitmasking Documentation

## Overview

Bitmasking is a technique used in programming to manipulate individual bits within a binary representation of numbers or other data. By using bitmasking, you can perform operations like setting, clearing, or toggling specific bits within a binary number. This documentation explains how to find, set, and clear a specific bit using bitmasking.

## Operations

### 1. Finding the `i`th Bit

**Problem:**

Given a binary number, find whether the `i`th bit is 1 or 0.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Binary Number: 0010101
Find the 5th bit
```

**Steps:**

1. Take the number `1` and left shift (`<<`) it by `i` positions.
   - Formula: `1 << i`
2. Perform a bitwise AND (`&`) operation between the result of the shift and the original number.
   - Formula: `result = (number & (1 << i))`
3. If the result is greater than `0`, the `i`th bit is `1`; otherwise, it is `0`.

**Code Example:**

```python
def find_ith_bit(number, i):
    if number & (1 << i):
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

# Example usage:
binary_number = 0b0010101
ith_bit = 5
print(find_ith_bit(binary_number, ith_bit))  # Output: 1
```

### 2. Setting the `i`th Bit

**Problem:**

Set the `i`th bit of a binary number to `1`.

**Steps:**

1. Take the number `1` and left shift (`<<`) it by `i` positions.
   - Formula: `1 << i`
2. Perform a bitwise OR (`|`) operation between the result of the shift and the original number.
   - Formula: `result = (number | (1 << i))`

**Code Example:**

```python
def set_ith_bit(number, i):
    return number | (1 << i)

# Example usage:
binary_number = 0b0010101
ith_bit = 3
print(bin(set_ith_bit(binary_number, ith_bit)))  # Output: 0b10101
```

### 3. Clearing the `i`th Bit

**Problem:**

Clear (set to `0`) the `i`th bit of a binary number.

**Steps:**

1. Take the number `1` and left shift (`<<`) it by `i` positions.
   - Formula: `1 << i`
2. Invert the result using bitwise NOT (`~`).
   - Formula: `mask = ~(1 << i)`
3. Perform a bitwise AND (`&`) operation between the inverted mask and the original number.
   - Formula: `result = (number & mask)`

**Code Example:**

```python
def clear_ith_bit(number, i):
    return number & ~(1 << i)

# Example usage:
binary_number = 0b0010101
ith_bit = 2
print(bin(clear_ith_bit(binary_number, ith_bit)))  # Output: 0b100101
```

## Summary

Bitmasking is a powerful technique for manipulating individual bits within a binary number. This documentation covered three common operations:

- **Finding the `i`th bit:** Identifying whether a specific bit is set or not.
- **Setting the `i`th bit:** Ensuring a specific bit is set to `1`.
- **Clearing the `i`th bit:** Ensuring a specific bit is set to `0`.

These operations are fundamental in low-level programming, bit manipulation, and optimizing performance-critical code.
