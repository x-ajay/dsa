# Finding Previous Smallest and Next Smallest Elements in an Array

This document explains how to find the **previous smallest element** and the **next smallest element** in an array using Go (Golang).

## Introduction

When working with arrays, you might need to find the smallest element that is located before or after a particular element in the array. This can be useful in various algorithms, such as when processing elements in a stack or analyzing subarrays.

### Previous Smallest Element

The **previous smallest element** for an element `arr[i]` is the closest element to the left of `arr[i]` that is smaller than `arr[i]`. If no such element exists, we typically return a sentinel value (like `-1` or `math.MinInt`).

### Next Smallest Element

The **next smallest element** for an element `arr[i]` is the closest element to the right of `arr[i]` that is smaller than `arr[i]`. Similar to the previous smallest element, if no such element exists, we return a sentinel value.

## Implementation in Go

Below is a Go implementation for finding the previous and next smallest elements.

### Previous Smallest Element

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// PreviousSmallest returns an array where each element is the previous
// smallest element for the corresponding element in the input array.
func PreviousSmallest(arr []int) []int {
	n := len(arr)
	result := make([]int, n)
	stack := []int{}

	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		// Pop elements from stack until we find the previous smaller element
		for len(stack) > 0 && stack[len(stack)-1] >= arr[i] {
			stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
		}

		// If the stack is not empty, the top element is the previous smaller
		// otherwise, no previous smaller element exists.
		if len(stack) == 0 {
			result[i] = -1
		} else {
			result[i] = stack[len(stack)-1]
		}

		// Push current element to stack
		stack = append(stack, arr[i])
	}

	return result
}

func main() {
	arr := []int{4, 10, 5, 8, 20, 15, 3, 12}
	fmt.Println("Array:", arr)
	fmt.Println("Previous Smallest Elements:", PreviousSmallest(arr))
}
```

### Next Smallest Element

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// NextSmallest returns an array where each element is the next
// smallest element for the corresponding element in the input array.
func NextSmallest(arr []int) []int {
	n := len(arr)
	result := make([]int, n)
	stack := []int{}

	for i := n - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
		// Pop elements from stack until we find the next smaller element
		for len(stack) > 0 && stack[len(stack)-1] >= arr[i] {
			stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
		}

		// If the stack is not empty, the top element is the next smaller
		// otherwise, no next smaller element exists.
		if len(stack) == 0 {
			result[i] = -1
		} else {
			result[i] = stack[len(stack)-1]
		}

		// Push current element to stack
		stack = append(stack, arr[i])
	}

	return result
}

func main() {
	arr := []int{4, 10, 5, 8, 20, 15, 3, 12}
	fmt.Println("Array:", arr)
	fmt.Println("Next Smallest Elements:", NextSmallest(arr))
}
```

## How It Works

### Previous Smallest Element

1. **Stack-Based Approach**: We use a stack to keep track of elements that we haven't yet found a smaller preceding element for.
2. **Traverse the Array**: We traverse the array from left to right. For each element, we compare it with the top of the stack (which represents the most recent element that hasn't yet found its smaller predecessor).
3. **Stack Management**: If the current element is smaller than the top of the stack, we pop elements from the stack until we find one that is smaller. The popped elements can't be the previous smaller for any future element.

### Next Smallest Element

1. **Reverse Traverse**: We perform a similar stack-based approach but traverse the array from right to left.
2. **Similar Logic**: The logic is similar to the previous smallest element but in reverse order, helping us find the next smallest element efficiently.

## Example

Given the array `[4, 10, 5, 8, 20, 15, 3, 12]`:

- **Previous Smallest**: `[-1, 4, 4, 5, 8, 8, -1, 3]`
- **Next Smallest**: `[3, 5, 3, 3, 15, 3, -1, -1]`

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` for both previous and next smallest element functions. Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the stack used in the computation.

## Conclusion

The methods described above efficiently find the previous and next smallest elements in an array using a stack-based approach. These methods are useful in problems involving monotonic stacks or in various optimization scenarios.

This document explains how to check if a string containing parentheses is valid using Go (Golang).

## Introduction

A string containing only the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['`, and `']'` is considered valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

### Examples of Valid and Invalid Strings
- **Valid**: `"()"`, `"()[]{}"`, `"{[()]}"`.
- **Invalid**: `"(]"`, `"([)]"`, `"{]"`.

## Implementation in Go

The following Go implementation uses a stack-based approach to check if a given string containing parentheses is valid.

### Valid Parentheses Function

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// IsValid checks if the input string s contains valid parentheses.
func IsValid(s string) bool {
	// Stack to keep track of opening brackets
	stack := []rune{}

	// Map to hold matching pairs of parentheses
	pairMap := map[rune]rune{
		')': '(',
		'}': '{',
		']': '[',
	}

	// Iterate through each character in the string
	for _, char := range s {
		// If the character is a closing bracket
		if matchingChar, exists := pairMap[char]; exists {
			// Check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack doesn't match the corresponding opening bracket
			if len(stack) == 0 || stack[len(stack)-1] != matchingChar {
				return false
			}
			// Pop the top element from the stack
			stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
		} else {
			// If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
			stack = append(stack, char)
		}
	}

	// If the stack is empty, all opening brackets have been matched
	return len(stack) == 0
}

func main() {
	examples := []string{
		"()",
		"()[]{}",
		"(]",
		"([)]",
		"{[()]}",
		"{[]}",
		"{[}",
	}

	for _, example := range examples {
		fmt.Printf("Is the string \"%s\" valid? %v\n", example, IsValid(example))
	}
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Stack-Based Approach**: We use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. This allows us to easily match them with closing brackets in the correct order.
2. **Map for Matching Pairs**: A map is used to store the matching pairs of parentheses. This makes it easy to check if a closing bracket matches the corresponding opening bracket.
3. **Iterate Through the String**: As we iterate through the string, we perform the following:
    - If we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack.
    - If we encounter a closing bracket, we check the top of the stack:
        - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket, the string is invalid.
        - Otherwise, we pop the stack.
4. **Final Check**: After processing the entire string, if the stack is empty, the string is valid. If not, it means there are unmatched opening brackets.

## Example

Given the strings:

- `"()"` → Valid
- `"()[]{}"` → Valid
- `"(]"` → Invalid
- `"([)]"` → Invalid
- `"{[()]}"` → Valid

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` in the worst case, where the stack contains all the opening brackets.
