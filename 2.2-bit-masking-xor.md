# Bit Manipulation and XOR Operations

## Overview

Bit manipulation is a powerful technique used to solve a variety of computational problems efficiently. XOR (exclusive OR) is one of the fundamental operations in bit manipulation, with the following key properties:

### XOR Properties:

1. **Identity**:
   \[
   n \oplus n = 0
   \]
2. **Zero Element**:
   \[
   0 \oplus n = n
   \]
3. **Commutative and Associative**:
   \[
   a \oplus b = b \oplus a
   \]
   \[
   (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c)
   \]

These properties are particularly useful in problems where elements appear in pairs, and the goal is to find a unique or non-repeating element.

### Q: Find the Non-Repeating Element in an Array Where Every Element Appears Twice

**Problem**: Given an array where every element appears twice except for one, find the element that appears only once.

**Approach**: Utilize the XOR operation, as any number XORed with itself results in 0, leaving only the non-repeating element.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	arr := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
	res := 0
	for i := 0; i < len(arr); i++ {
		res ^= arr[i]
	}
	fmt.Println("Non-repeating element:", res)
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- The XOR operation cancels out all pairs, leaving only the non-repeating element.

### Q: Find Two Non-Repeating Elements in an Array Where Every Element Appears Twice

**Problem**: Given an array where every element appears twice except for two elements, find the two non-repeating elements.

**Approach**: 
1. XOR all elements to get `diff`, which is the XOR of the two non-repeating elements (`a ^ b`).
2. Find the rightmost set bit in `diff` to differentiate between the two elements.
3. Partition the array based on this bit and XOR within each partition to find the two unique elements.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	arr := []int{7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
	diff := 0
	
	// XOR all elements to find a ^ b
	for i := 0; i < len(arr); i++ {
		diff ^= arr[i]
	}

	fmt.Printf("Before: %b\n", diff) // Binary representation of diff
	
	// Isolate the rightmost set bit
	diff &= -diff
	fmt.Printf("After: %b\n", diff) // Isolated rightmost set bit

	res := [2]int{}
	for i := 0; i < len(arr); i++ {
		if arr[i]&diff == 0 {
			res[0] ^= arr[i] // XOR for one group
		} else {
			res[1] ^= arr[i] // XOR for the other group
		}
	}
	fmt.Println("Non-repeating elements:", res) // Outputs [9,7]
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- The XOR operation splits the array into two groups based on the isolated bit, each containing one unique element.

### Q: Find the Only Non-Repeating Element in an Array Where Every Other Element Repeats 3 Times

**Problem**: Given an array where every element appears three times except for one, find the non-repeating element.

**Approach**: 
1. Count the number of 1s in each bit position across all numbers.
2. For each bit position, if the count is not a multiple of 3, the non-repeating element has a `1` in that bit position.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	arr := []int{1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5}
	k := 3
	bits := [32]int{}
	
	// Count the number of 1s in each bit position
	for i := range arr {
		for j := 0; j < 32; j++ {
			if (arr[i] & (1 << j)) != 0 {
				bits[j]++
			}
		}
	}

	// Reconstruct the non-repeating element
	res := float64(0)
	for i := 0; i < 32; i++ {
		if bits[i]%k != 0 {
			res += math.Pow(2, float64(i))
		}
	}
	fmt.Println("Non-repeating element:", int(res))
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- The bits that are not multiples of 3 represent the unique number, which is reconstructed using these bit positions.
